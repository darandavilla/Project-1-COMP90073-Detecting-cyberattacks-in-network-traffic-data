Project 1: Detecting cyberattacks in network traffic data

In this Project, we were given network traffic data and used Splunk to identify cyberattacks by leveraging the analytics capabilities of this software. The aim was to strengthen our skills in analyzing traffic patterns and identifying their changes over time, which might be signs of suspicious activities. In searching the evidences of cyberattacks, and hunting the attack sources and targets, we developed the practical security incident investigation skills and mindset of a real-world Cyber Security Analyst. In addition, we skilled-up ourselves in tracing attacks back in time to create an attack narrative. Then generating and extracting significant patterns/features of detected attacks paved the way for the next project that is heavily machine learning focused. Lastly, we developed our skills as a Cyber Defender by proposing the countermeasures to detect/mitigate similar attacks in the future.
